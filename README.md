About
========

INTruDer is a set of algorithms that identify protein isoforms yielded by gene truncations following chromosomal rearrangements. It was developed for use in the context of an existing NGS pipeline (SVAtools, maprseq3) that uses mate-pair sequencing (MPseq) to identify chromosomal breakpoints in a genome, and RNA read pairs that span those breakpoints.

The INTruDer pipeline is characterized as follows:
